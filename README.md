# Online-Portofolio
My personal website portofolio with some of my main projects and links to contact me included.

https://orest-z.github.io/Online-Portofolio/

**NOTICE** This repo was created pretty fast and i have used the help of an ai assistant since i needed to create it very fast and in a rush. I know the repo is not in the best shape possible one main concern of mine is that it is a single big html file. I know they should be seperated for better readability and also provide documentation in the future but for now this is all i have done. I will be looking forward ofcourse to improve the structure of my online portofolio website. Thank you! **NOTICE**
